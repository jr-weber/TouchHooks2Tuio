# TouchHooks2Tuio
The TouchHooks2Tuio program monitors Windows 8 touch events and resends them as 
/tuio/2Dcur messages for use by a TUIO-aware multitouch application.

Run Requirements:

* Windows 8 operating system.
* Multitouch hardware that generates Windows 8 touch events.
* A TUIO-aware client application.

Build Requirements:

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Community Edtion
      https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx
* Qt Framework version 5.4 (or higher)
      http://www.qt.io/download/
* Visual Studio Add-in 1.2.4 (or higher) for Qt 5

1. TouchHooks2Tuio is based directly on the Touch2Tuio program written by
   Marc Herrlich and Benjamin Walther-Franks at the University of Bremen.

2. For sending TUIO UDP messages on port 3333, TouchHooks2Tuio uses the
   TUIO_CPP server reference implementation from reacTIVision.

3. For sending FLASH XML messages on port 3000, TouchHooks2Tuio uses an 
   ofxTCPServer class borrowed from openFrameworks (but rebuilt for 
   Visual Studio 2013), which in turn uses the POCO library.

Overview:

TouchHooks2Tuio is based on the Touch2Tuio program, but uses a different
hook strategy.  The original Touch2Tuio program attached a hook to the
window for a single multitouch app by entering the title for that window
on the command line when Touch2Tuio starts up.  TouchHooks2Tuio, on the 
other hand, uses a global hook that listens for Windows 8 touch events from 
all open windows.  Therefore, the hook does not need to be released and then 
reattached each time a differenct multitouch app is fired up.

TouchHooks2Tuio also adds a GUI with a menubar and a text area for reporting
the status of the TUIO servers (see the TouchHooks2Tuio-GUI.png file).
The 3 TUIO servers use localhost (127.0.0.1), and can be operated in parallel:

    TUIO UDP channel one on port 3333 (used by most TUIO-aware apps)
	TUIO UDP channel two on port 3334
	Flash XML TCP on port 3000 (older standard for Flash apps)
	
The Network menu can be used to toggle any of these channels on/off, and, if
desired, the port numbers can be changed in a configuration file (look for
the TouchHoos2TuioSettings.xml file in the Data/Settings subdirectory).
To toggle the global hook on/off, use the Hooks menu.  When the global hook
is attached, it also intercepts and blocks the emulated mouse clicks that 
are generated by default from Windows 8 touch events.

Basic Usage:

1. Plug in your Windows 8 touch device (monitor, bezel, or whatever).
2. Double-click on TouchHooks2Tuio.exe.
3. Check the text area of the GUI to see that the servers started ok.  
   The most likely cause of failure would be if a port number was 
   already in use by another program.
4. For most TUIO-based multitouch apps, TUIO UDP on channel 1 (port 3333)
   should be turned on (use the Network menu if needed).
5. Start up a TUIO-based multitouch app.
